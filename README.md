## Motivation

I really enjoy using the everforest theme, but it is not available for all the tools I use (obviously it is not that popular as [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin)), so I decided to make a collection of everforest themes for various tools.

## Tools

My everforest theme collection for various tools. Most are everforest dark soft.

1. [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim): [everforest.nvim](https://github.com/neanias/everforest-nvim) and of course, the original [everforest](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest).
2. [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/): use `kitten theme` then select the `everforest` theme.
3. [Wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/): use the `everforest` theme directly in the config lua file-> [everforest wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/colorschemes/e/index.html#everforest-dark-gogh).
4. [siokek](https://github.com/ahrm/sioyek): see my `sioyek` folder.
5. [yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi): see my `yazi` folder.
6. [vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium): see my vimuim folder. Put the `css` in to `CSS for Vimium UI`.
7. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/): Actually, Multiple options:
   1. There are 3 community theme for `everforest`:
      - [obsidian-everforest](https://github.com/0xGlitchbyte/obsidian_everforest).
      - [everforest-enchanted](https://github.com/FireIsGood/obsidian-everforest-enchanted)
      - [obsidian-minimal](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal): By default, minimal theme is not everforest, but you can chosse the everforest by using [obsidian-minimal-setting](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal-settings).
   2. If you use [shimmering-focus](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/shimmering-focus), which I highly recommend for vimer, you can use my `everforest.css` in the `obsidian` folder.
8. Github: you can use [refined-github](https://github.com/refined-github/refined-github), and put the css in the `css` in the 'refined-github' folder to the Custom CSS option in refined-github.
9. [bottom](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom): see my `bottom` folder.
